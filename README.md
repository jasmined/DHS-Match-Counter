# DHS-Match-Counter
Fictional issue: The US	Department of Homeland Security	determine potential unwanted individual sat the next United Nations conference scheduled in New York City. The US office received an encrypted list of ill-intentioned people who may want to show up to the conference and needs to be able to match the names on this list to the names of actual attendees.The problem that they are facing is that they managed to only partially decrypt the names	of potential troublemakers. The decryption process is taking a long time and the conference is about to begin.

This program matches the list of partially decrypted names to the names of actual attendees and generates a report that shows matching percentages between the names on both lists.
